# AtomGPS Wigler

## Overview
**AtomGPS Wigler** is a wardriving tool originally created by [@lozaning](https://github.com/lozaning) for use with the M5Stack Atom GPS kit. 

This tool is specifically designed for Wi-Fi network scanning and includes LED status indicators. It offers features such as dynamic channel hopping and deduplication. Writes CSV files compatible with wigle.net.

## Flashing
- **Grab the codebase:**
    ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/lukeswitz/AtomGPS_wigler.git
    cd AtomGPS_wigler/build
    ```

### Method One: [Esptool.py](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esptool/en/latest/esp32/)

**1. Locate the device:**
   - Linux/macOS:
     ```bash
     ls /dev/ttyUSB*
     # or
     ls /dev/cu.*
     ```
   - Windows, check COM port in Device Manager.

**2. Flash the firmware, partition and bootloader:**

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure you have the latest version of esptool.py installed from the link above, or a known warning about header fields will display when flashing.

  - Navigate to the build folder (if not already there).   
  - Flash using the following command **inside the build folder or by specifying file paths:**

`esptool.py -p [YOUR_PORT] -b 1500000 --before default_reset --after hard_reset --chip esp32 write_flash --flash_mode dio --flash_size detect --flash_freq 80m 0x1000 AtomGPS_wigler_v1_4.bootloader.bin 0x8000 AtomGPS_wigler_v1_4.partitions.bin 0x10000 AtomGPS_wigler_v1_4.bin`

---

### Method 2: [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

**1. Open **the .ino file** in Arduino IDE (or copy and paste it into a new sketch).**

**2. Add the ESP32 Boards Repo:**
   
   -  Open Arduino IDE.
   -  Go to `File > Preferences`.
   -  Add `https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json` to "Additional Boards Manager URLs."

## Use

After flashing, the device scans for Wi-Fi networks, using LEDs to display status. Network data is saved in Wigle.net-compatible CSV files on the SD card, each with a timestamp and unique run number. For issues, refer to the main repository.

**LED Indicators:**
> [!NOTE]  
>- Press and hold the button during scanning to toggle the Green LED.
- RED blink if the SD card is missing/write error.
- PURPLE blink while waiting for a GPS fix.
- GREEN blink during scanning (Optional).
